Elasticsearch
Download latest version of Elasticsearch from this download page and unzip it any folder.
Run bin\elasticsearch.bat from command prompt.
By default, it would start at http://localhost:9200
Kibana
Download the latest distribution from download page and unzip into any folder.
Open config/kibana.yml in an editor and set elasticsearch.url to point at your Elasticsearch instance. In our case as we will use the local instance just uncomment elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9200"
Run bin\kibana.bat from command prompt.
Once started successfully, Kibana will start on default port 5601 and Kibana UI will be available at http://localhost:5601
Logstash
Download the latest distribution from download page and unzip into any folder.
Create one file logstash.conf as per configuration instructions. We will again come to this point during actual demo time for exact configuration.
Now open  bin  and run logstash -f logstash.conf to start logstash
